- Calculating & Displaying Summary
- Calculating & Displaying Balance
- Transfering Money
- Requesting Loan

## Lessons Learned

I have learned in depth that how Js works with Arrays. I also learned to work with numbers, creating dates, internationalization & how to work with timers.

It was a great journey. I liked it very much.

The challenges which I faced is in the time of implementing the logout feature because of timers. But I took the challenge and finished it in well manner.

## Optimizations

I have refactored my code by making it in a modular type. Every features I have created in side a funtion. The codes which were running again and again, I have made it a function.
I have also made reusable functions, which will also help me in future to use it in other applications.
